- ❌ Keep other fields disabled to avoid clutter

### 📏 Label Size Guidelines
- **Thermal 4x6**: Best for shipping labels and large products
- **Thermal 2x1**: Perfect for small items and inventory management
- **A4 Labels**: Ideal for office printers and bulk printing
- **Custom Sizes**: Use for specialized label requirements

### 🖨️ Printer Compatibility
- **Office Printers**: Use A4/Letter with multiple labels per page
- **Thermal Printers**: Use dedicated thermal sizes (4x6, 2x1)
- **Label Printers**: Configure custom dimensions as needed

### ⚡ Performance Tips
- Enable batch mode for generating large quantities
- Use appropriate barcode types (Code 128 for general use)
- Test with small batches before large print runs
- Keep field selection minimal for faster generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Barcode not generating**: Ensure product has SKU or barcode field filled
2. **Labels too small**: Adjust label dimensions in template settings
3. **Text cut off**: Reduce text size or increase label height
4. **Print quality poor**: Check printer DPI settings and label material

### Field Display Not Working
1. Verify settings are saved in Admin Panel > Settings > Barcode Generator
2. Check that at least one field is enabled
3. Clear cache if changes don't appear immediately
4. Ensure template is compatible with field settings
